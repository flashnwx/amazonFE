This policy does not extend to information or services provided by third parties integrated into or linked to the products or services of the Guanggan Platform, including third-party applications, websites, etc. These services or information are operated by third parties and are subject to the personal information protection policy or similar provisions of those third parties. II. Information Collection and Use When you use our products and services, we may collect and use your personal information, including the following: 1. To provide you with the basic functions of our products and/or services, you must authorize us to collect and use the necessary information. If you decline to provide this information, you will not be able to utilize our products and/or services as intended. 2. To provide you with additional functions of our products and/or services, you may choose to agree or disagree separately with the information we collect and use. Refusing to provide this information will result in the inability to use additional features or lacking access to the intended functionality. This will not affect your use of our basic functions. We wish to emphasize that our commitment to creating a variety of products and services to meet your needs means that there may be differences in the types and scope of personal information collected and used for basic and additional functions due to the diverse range of products and services we offer and varying product/service choices made by different users. Please refer to the specific product/service features for accurate information. The specific functional scenarios we will provide you include: (I) Assisting You in Becoming Our Member and Account Management 1. Basic Member Services We offer services based on your Guanggan Platform account. To create a Guanggan Platform account, you must provide us with your email. Failure to provide the above information will prevent you from registering a Guanggan Platform account, and you can only use browsing and search services. We will assess your current level based on your usage of the Guanggan Platform account and the account level calculation rules set by the platform. We will provide you with corresponding basic rights associated with your account level. 2. Additional Member Services Special member privileges: If you opt to provide your real name, gender, date of birth, place of residence, nickname, and avatar, we can offer you member privilege services. Your chosen nickname and avatar will be publicly displayed. Authorized login: With your individual consent, we may provide your account information (avatar, nickname, and other displayed information) to third parties, allowing you to easily register with third-party accounts or log in directly to third-party services. Additionally, with your individual consent, we may obtain your third-party account information from third parties and link it to your Guanggan Platform account, enabling you to log in and use our products and services directly through third parties. We will use your relevant information within the scope of your individual consent. If you already have a Guanggan Platform account, we may display your personal information and the actions you perform on the Guanggan Platform or products and services associated with the Guanggan Platform account. This includes centralized display of your profile, special offers, and transaction orders on the Guanggan Platform. We will respect the choices you make regarding Guanggan Platform services and Guanggan Platform account settings. 3. Identity Verification To comply with relevant legal requirements and regulatory demands, ensure the authenticity of user identity, implement anti-fraud and risk control measures, and safeguard system and service security, we may need to collect your relevant information for identity verification when you use specific services/features, including: [Account Recovery] When you use the \\\"account recovery\\\" function, we may collect your identity information, including your real name and ID card number, to verify your identity and assist you in recovering your Guanggan Platform account. [Account Enhanced Protection] When you use the account enhanced protection function, you can choose to submit facial recognition information or voiceprint information to enable facial and voice recognition verification. Refusing to provide the aforementioned sensitive personal information will only result in your inability to use the corresponding function but will not affect your normal use of other functions. [Real Name/Real Person Authentication] For transactions involving special types of goods or services, applying for member roles with additional identity verification requirements (such as sellers, content creators), and other scenarios requiring verification of the user's real identity under the law (including protecting the rights of minors under the law, combating telecommunications network fraud, withholding personal income tax, determining the relevant entities in administrative law enforcement or judicial litigation), you will need to undergo real name or real person authentication. To achieve the authentication purpose, you need to actively provide relevant real identity information (name, ID card number, or facial recognition information, as applicable based on the prompts on the page) and authorize us to verify your information through nationally authorized and credible identity verification agencies. Depending on the situation, we may also obtain necessary authentication information binding your Alipay account and WeChat account from Alipay and Tencent companies, respectively. We will lawfully record and retain authentication information and the authentication result, using this information solely for the purpose of completing authentication or other purposes required by laws and regulations. It will not be used for other purposes without your explicit authorization. Furthermore, when you participate in promotions and interactive activities on the platform, we may need to query your Alipay account or WeChat account's real-name authentication status from Alipay and Tencent companies to verify your basic participation conditions and ensure your activity experience.

Additionally, we will conduct statistical analysis of user trends, hotspots, and trends in browsing and searching for goods or services on the Guanggan Platform to create relevant curated lists and provide recommendations. Personalized recommendation and retrieval algorithms will match goods, services, or other information that may interest you based on predicted preference characteristics, and will sort the displayed items accordingly. We will offer real-time feedback on the recommendation model based on your browsing behavior during product usage, continuously adjusting and optimizing recommendation results. To meet your diverse needs, we will introduce various recommendation technologies into the sorting process, expand recommended content, and avoid excessive concentration of similar content. Simultaneously, we take measures to ensure your privacy as follows: 1. If you wish to stop receiving commercial advertisements from us, you can unsubscribe or opt-out by replying to SMS prompts or through other methods we provide. 2. If you need to view sorting not tailored to your personal characteristics when using our on-site search service, you can click on \\\"Filter\\\" on the search results page and choose options like \\\"Sales,\\\" \\\"Price,\\\" or \\\"General Sorting.\\\" 3. If you do not want to see recommended products or services on the homepage or payment completion page, you can long-press the recommended product or service image and, in the subsequent pop-up window, choose to block similar products or the category to which the product or service belongs. 4.

This policy pertains to all products\n    and services offered by Guanggan. In cases where products or services from\n    us or our affiliated companies use Guanggan's products or services and do\n    not have their own independent personal information protection policy, this\n    policy shall apply to that part. However, if products or services from us or\n    our affiliated companies have their independent personal information\n    protection policy, that independent policy will take precedence. Any content\n    not covered by the independent policy but included in this policy will be\n    governed by this policy. 2. This policy does not extend to information or\n    services provided by third parties integrated into or linked to the products\n    or services of the Guanggan Platform, including third-party applications,\n    websites, etc. These services or information are operated by third parties\n    and are subject to the personal information protection policy or similar\n    provisions of those third parties.

To provide you with the basic\n    functions of our products and/or services, you must authorize us to collect\n    and use the necessary information. If you decline to provide this\n    information, you will not be able to utilize our products and/or services as\n    intended. 2. To provide you with additional functions of our products and/or\n    services, you may choose to agree or disagree separately with the\n    information we collect and use. Refusing to provide this information will\n    result in the inability to use additional features or lacking access to the\n    intended functionality. This will not affect your use of our basic\n    functions. We wish to emphasize that our commitment to creating a variety of\n    products and services to meet your needs means that there may be differences\n    in the types and scope of personal information collected and used for basic\n    and additional functions due to the diverse range of products and services\n    we offer and varying product/service choices made by different users. Please\n    refer to the specific product/service features for accurate information. The\n    specific functional scenarios we will provide you include: (I) Assisting You\n    in Becoming Our Member and Account Management 1. Basic Member Services We\n    offer services based on your Guanggan Platform account. To create a Guanggan\n    Platform account, you must provide us with your email. Failure to provide\n    the above information will prevent you from registering a Guanggan Platform\n    account, and you can only use browsing and search services. We will assess\n    your current level based on your usage of the Guanggan Platform account and\n    the account level calculation rules set by the platform. We will provide you\n    with corresponding basic rights associated with your account level. 2.\n    Additional Member Services Special member privileges: If you opt to provide\n    your real name, gender, date of birth, place of residence, nickname, and\n    avatar, we can offer you member privilege services. Your chosen nickname and\n    avatar will be publicly displayed. Authorized login: With your individual\n    consent, we may provide your account information (avatar, nickname, and\n    other displayed information) to third parties, allowing you to easily\n    register with third-party accounts or log in directly to third-party\n    services. Additionally, with your individual consent, we may obtain your\n    third-party account information from third parties and link it to your\n    Guanggan Platform account, enabling you to log in and use our products and\n    services directly through third parties. We will use your relevant\n    information within the scope of your individual consent. If you already have\n    a Guanggan Platform account, we may display your personal information and\n    the actions you perform on the Guanggan Platform or products and services\n    associated with the Guanggan Platform account. This includes centralized\n    display of your profile, special offers, and transaction orders on the\n    Guanggan Platform. We will respect the choices you make regarding Guanggan\n    Platform services and Guanggan Platform account settings. 3. Identity\n    Verification To comply with relevant legal requirements and regulatory\n    demands, ensure the authenticity of user identity, implement anti-fraud and\n    risk control measures, and safeguard system and service security, we may\n    need to collect your relevant information for identity verification when you\n    use specific services/features, including: [Account Recovery] When you use\n    the \"account recovery\" function, we may collect your identity information,\n    including your real name and ID card number, to verify your identity and\n    assist you in recovering your Guanggan Platform account. [Account Enhanced\n    Protection] When you use the account enhanced protection function, you can\n    choose to submit facial recognition information or voiceprint information to\n    enable facial and voice recognition verification. Refusing to provide the\n    aforementioned sensitive personal information will only result in your\n    inability to use the corresponding function but will not affect your normal\n    use of other functions. [Real Name/Real Person Authentication] For\n    transactions involving special types of goods or services, applying for\n    member roles with additional identity verification requirements (such as\n    sellers, content creators), and other scenarios requiring verification of\n    the user's real identity under the law (including protecting the rights of\n    minors under the law, combating telecommunications network fraud,\n    withholding personal income tax, determining the relevant entities in\n    administrative law enforcement or judicial litigation), you will need to\n    undergo real name or real person authentication. To achieve the\n    authentication purpose, you need to actively provide relevant real identity\n    information (name, ID card number, or facial recognition information, as\n    applicable based on the prompts on the page) and authorize us to verify your\n    information through nationally authorized and credible identity verification\n    agencies. Depending on the situation, we may also obtain necessary\n    authentication information binding your Alipay account and WeChat account\n    from Alipay and Tencent companies, respectively. We will lawfully record and\n    retain authentication information and the authentication result, using this\n    information solely for the purpose of completing authentication or other\n    purposes required by laws and regulations. It will not be used for other\n    purposes without your explicit authorization. Furthermore, when you\n    participate in promotions and interactive activities on the platform, we may\n    need to query your Alipay account or WeChat account's real-name\n    authentication status from Alipay and Tencent companies to verify your basic\n    participation conditions and ensure your activity experience. (II) Providing\n    Product/Service Information Display, Recommendations, and Push Notifications\n    In order to offer you product/service information display, recommendations,\n    and push notifications, we will collect and use your information, which\n    includes your name, phone number, browsing history, and search history when\n    you visit or use the Guanggan Platform website or client. We will utilize\n    device information collected in compliance with the law, service log\n    information, and other authorized data to predict your preference\n    characteristics using algorithm models. Based on these characteristics, we\n    will push commercial advertisements and other potentially interesting\n    information on the Guanggan Platform and other third-party applications or\n    send commercial text messages. Additionally, we will conduct statistical\n    analysis of user trends, hotspots, and trends in browsing and searching for\n    goods or services on the Guanggan Platform to create relevant curated lists\n    and provide recommendations. Personalized recommendation and retrieval\n    algorithms will match goods, services, or other information that may\n    interest you based on predicted preference characteristics, and will sort\n    the displayed items accordingly. We will offer real-time feedback on the\n    recommendation model based on your browsing behavior during product usage,\n    continuously adjusting and optimizing recommendation results. To meet your\n    diverse needs, we will introduce various recommendation technologies into\n    the sorting process, expand recommended content, and avoid excessive\n    concentration of similar content. Simultaneously, we take measures to ensure\n    your privacy as follows: 1. If you wish to stop receiving commercial\n    advertisements from us, you can unsubscribe or opt-out by replying to SMS\n    prompts or through other methods we provide. 2. If you need to view sorting\n    not tailored to your personal characteristics when using our on-site search\n    service, you can click on \"Filter\" on the search results page and choose\n    options like \"Sales,\" \"Price,\" or \"General Sorting.\" 3. If you do not want\n    to see recommended products or services on the homepage or payment\n    completion page, you can long-press the recommended product or service image\n    and, in the subsequent pop-up window, choose to block similar products or\n    the category to which the product or service belongs. 4. If you wish to\n    manage the personalized advertisements we send you, you can go to \"Me -\n    Settings - Privacy Settings - Ad Management\" to make adjustments. 5. If you\n    want to manage the personalized content we push to you, you can go to \"Me -\n    Settings - Privacy Settings - Recommendation Management\" to make\n    adjustments.

(IV) Assisting You in Placing Orders and Managing Orders When\n    you order specific goods and/or services through our products and/or\n    services, we will generate an order for the purchase of these goods and/or\n    services on your behalf.

The order will\n    include information about the goods and/or services you have purchased, a\n    specific order number, order creation time, the amount you need to pay, and\n    any notes you provide. We collect this information to assist you in\n    completing transactions, ensure the security of your transactions,\n    facilitate order tracking, provide customer service and after-sales\n    services, and for other purposes that we explicitly communicate to you. You\n    can also place orders for others through the Guanggan Platform.

If you opt for other financial institutions to provide payment\n    services, we will also share your necessary bank card information, including\n    the card number and expiration date, with the relevant financial institution\n    of your choice. If you need others to make payments on your behalf, you will\n    need to provide the payer's Payment Institution account and/or phone number.\n    To monitor and confirm your payment progress and status promptly, as well as\n    to provide after-sales and dispute resolution services, you agree that we\n    may collect payment-related information from the transaction parties,\n    Payment Institutions, or other financial institutions you choose.
